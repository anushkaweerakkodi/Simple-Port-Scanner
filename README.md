# 🔍 Simple Python Port Scanner

A lightweight and efficient network reconnaissance tool built with Python. This scanner checks for common open ports on a target IP address to help identify potential entry points for security auditing.

## 🚀 Features
* **Custom Input:** Users can enter any target IP address or hostname.
* **Error Handling:** Robust protection against invalid hostnames and network timeouts.
* **Multi-Port Scanning:** Scans a predefined list of high-priority ports (21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 443, 3389).
* **Speed:** Optimized with a 1-second timeout per port for faster results.
